<h2>What Is An Earthquake?</h2>
<p>An earthquake is when tectonic plates shift and release built up stress in the form of seismic waves which cause tremors along the fault lines of the
  surface of the earth and damage large cities.</p>

  <h2>Where Do Earthquakes Happen?</h2>
  <p>An earthquake usually occurs where continental and oceanic plates run against each other or come into contact and send seismic waves.
    They can also occur along areas called <strong>Faults</strong>. These faults are cracks along the edges of the plates which are created by their
    movements along each other. The largest fault line is called the <strong>Pacific Ring of Fire</strong> that stretches along the Pacific coasts
    of the countries that lie along the ring.</p>

  <h2>When Do Earthquakes Occur?</h2>
  <p>Many of us often disregard the fact that earthquakes happen everyday somewhere in the world. Earthquakes averaging magnitude 2 happen everyday along the
    fault lines of the earth. Other earthquakes stronger but average a magnitude 7 happen once a month. The strongest earthquakes averaging mangitudes 8
    or higher happen once a year. According to the National Earthquake Information Center, earthquakes of all magnitudes happen 12,000-14,000 times a year.</p>
<br />
  <h2>How Are Earthquakes Measured?<h2>
    <p>In the 1930's a seismologist named Dr. Charles Richter created the <strong>Richter Scale</strong>. This scale is able to gather the frequencies and energies
      of the seismic waves and is able to measure it from a scale of 1-10. 1 being the weakest possible earthquaek and 10 being the most destructive
      and largest earthquake possible.</p>

    <h2>How Do You Survive An Earthquake?</h2>
    <p>The most ideal move during an earthquake is to move under a desk or stay inside a car and not move from your position. This allows you to be
      covered from any falling debris coming from buildings and prevents you from being buried alive by dirt or debris so it is easier fro rescuers
      to locate you.</p>
