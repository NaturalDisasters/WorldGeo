      <h1>Volcanos</h1>
      <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, 
         volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. A volcano is a mountain that opens 
         downward to a reservoir of molten rock below the surface of the earth. Unlike most mountains, which are pushed up from
         below, volcanoes are vents through which molten rock escapes to the earthâ€™s surface. When pressure from gases within 
         the molten rock becomes too great, an eruption occurs. Eruptions can be quiet or explosive asa the molten lava is at a very high tempature.
         There may be lava flows, flattened landscapes, poisonous gases, and flying rock and ash that can sometimes travel hundreds of 
         miles downwind.</p>
