  <h3>An explanation of Causes</h3>
 <div id="Geologic Movements">
   <h3>Geologic Movements</h3>
   <p>The earth is made up of layers called <strong>tectonic plates</strong> and these plates lay along a layer of magma benetah the crust called mantle.
      The mantle constantly created a cycle beneath the earth which is also known as <strong>Mantle Convection</strong>. This process causes the plates to and shift over a period of time and eventually causes
     them to come against each other (Insurgent), break away from each other (Divergent) and slide against each other (Transform). The tension released from these movements
     is brought to the surface nad causes different natural disasters.</p>
