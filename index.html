   <h3>Geologic Movements</h3></div>
     <p>The earth is made up of layers called <strong>tectonic plates</strong> and these plates lay along a layer of magma benetah the crust called mantle.
      The mantle constantly created a cycle beneath the earth which is also known as <strong>Mantle Convection</strong>. This process causes the plates to and shift over a period of time and eventually causes
     them to come against each other <strong>(Insurgent)</strong>, break away from each other <strong>(Divergent)</strong> and slide against each other <strong>(Transform)</strong>. The tension released from these movements
       is brought to the surface and causes different natural disasters.</p></div>
