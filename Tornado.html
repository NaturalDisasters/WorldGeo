    <h3>Tornadoes</h3>
    <p>This page explains what to do when you recieve or get a warning aler fro, the Nation Weather Services 
      for your local area and what to do before, during and after A Tornado.</p>
    <h2>What</h2>
    <p> A Tornado is a rapidly roatating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a
      funnel cloud or, in rare cases, thr base of a funnel cloud. Tornadoes could cause death, injury, and damage to homes,
      the environment and humans depending on the severity of the tornado. The rapid spinning in a tornado is the result
      of the updrafts and downdrafts in the thunderstorm connecting with the wind shear, coming in a tilt of the wind
      shear to form an upright tornado vortex.There are different types of tornadoes in regards to the strength of them. F1,
      F2, F3, F4, anfd F5. F1 being the weakest and F5 being the strongest.</p>
    <h2>Where</h2>
          <ul>
             <li>Europe</li>
             <li>South Africa</li>
             <li>United Kingdom</li>
             <li>Japan</li>
             <li>Australia</li>

             <li>Bangladesh</li>
             <li>United States</li>
    </ul>
              <p>Even though the United Kingdom have more tornadoes than the United States, the tornadoes in the UK are fairly
                weak and the tornadoes in the Unted States are more bstronger with F5's and F4's at a high rate.</p>
    <h2>When</h2>
            <p>Tornadoes usually occur during the spring and summer months because of the weather patterns and changes.
              Tornadoes often form when cool, polar air traveling southeastward from the Rockies overrides warm, moist, unstable
              air.
