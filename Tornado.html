    <h2>What</h2>
    <p> A Tornado is a rapidly roatating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a
      funnel cloud or, in rare cases, thr base of a funnel cloud. Tornadoes could cause death, injury, and damage to homes,
      the environment and humans depending on the severity of the tornado. The rapid spinning in a tornado is the result
      of the updrafts and downdrafts in the thunderstorm connecting with the wind shear, coming in a tilt of the wind
      shear to form an upright tornado vortex.<p>
