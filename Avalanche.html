     <h2>What Is An Avalanche?</h2>
     <p>An Avalanche is the movement of snow and ice going down a slope and gaining speed and power as it rapidly moves down a cliff. Another
       common name for an avalanche is a <strong>Snow Slide</strong>. They are often compared to a landslide except an avalanche happens in a
       snowy terrain.</p>

       <h2>Where Do Avalanches Happen?</h2>
       <p>Avalanches mainly occur in the snowy mountainous regions of the 7 continents. According to the Government of Canada, more than a
         thousand avalanches occur each year in the territories and the mountianous areas of the western provinces and affect many Canadians
         annually.</p>

       <h2>How Do Avalanches Happen?</h2>
       <p>Avalanches are mainly caused by rain, wind, warm temperatures and earthquakes which trigger the unsteady snow to collapse and turn
         into an avalanche. There are also man made causes which are the movement of skiers and hikers or the vibration waves of construction
         and machinery which shakes the snow and creates an avalanche.</p>

       <h2>Why Are There Two Types?</h2>
       <p>There are two type of avalanches which are <strong>Loose Snow Avalanches</strong> and <strong>Slab Avalanches</strong>. A Loose Snow
         Avalanche is the rapid downward movement of non-crystalized snow and is made of pure snow with no ice. A Slab Avalanche is when well bonded
         snow comes down in the forms of slabs instead of individual snow particles.</p>

       <h2>What To Do When An Avalanche Occurs?</h2>
       <p>Many pro hikers and researchers suggest to try your best and move off the slab. To try and roll while under the snow as a log or 
         swim to remove snow and get closer to the surface. Then, push open a hole in the snow for breathing or to yell for help or any rescuers that
         are nearby. Then they suggest to wait and continue calling for help becasue 93% of survivors have been saved 15 minutes after an avalanche
         occurs.</p>
